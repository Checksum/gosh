# gosh
Simple HTTP file server for development with browser auto reload

## Why yet another server?

Needed a single binary which I can use on remote servers without having to install Python or a million Node.js dependencies.

## Installation

Download the binary for your OS from [releases](https://github.com/Checksum/gosh/releases). Put it in some path where it's accessible.

## Usage

`gosh -help` for available options.
